Q: I can't use some keybinding like <Shift><Super>dollar, <Shift><Super>parenleft, <Shift><Super>parenright.\
A: Seems like this is an issue depending on the keyboard layout used. For me (US intl. with dead keys) it helped to use in dconf Editor slightly different names:\
  <Shift><Super>dollar --> <Shift><Super>4\
  <Shift><Super>parenleft --> <Shift><Super>9\
  <Shift><Super>parenright --> <Shift><Super>0\
